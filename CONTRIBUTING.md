# Contributing to Pivotal Projects

Weâ€™d love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. Please review the following guidelines you'll need to follow in order to make a contribution.

## Contributor License Agreement

All contributors to this project must have a signed Contributor License Agreement (**"CLA"**) on file with us. The CLA grants us the permissions we need to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project; you or your employer retain the copyright to your contribution. Head over to https://cla.pivotal.io/ to see your current agreement(s) on file or to sign a new one.

We generally only need you (or your employer) to sign our CLA once and once signed, you should be able to submit contributions to any Pivotal project. 

Note: if you would like to submit an "_obvious fix_" for something like a typo, formatting issue or spelling mistake, you may not need to sign the CLA. Please see our information on [obvious fixes](https://cla.pivotal.io/about#obvious-fix) for more details.
